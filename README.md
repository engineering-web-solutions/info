# Syllabus for CS 1501 Engineering Web Solutions

### 0. Basics

**Course description**

Computer science is all about solving problems, and to solve a problem well, you must design a good solution. But what is good design and how can you implement it? This course will teach you how to work through the design process and use user-centered design thinking to build your own web solution. The structure of this course includes lectures on the design process and basic web development. There will be small homework assignments and a semester-long group project so you can apply the design and programming skills you learn in lecture.

### 5. Grading

This is a 1-credit pass/fail course. To pass, you must receive a grade of 70% or higher.

40% - **Attendance**. If you are going to miss class, please email us. We will excuse absences on a case-by-case basis, but you need to let us know beforehand.

30% - **Homework**. There are weekly homework assignments posted on the course [Github repository](https://github.com/). They will be submitted via Github. If you’ve never used Git or Github before, don’t worry! We’ll teach you everything you need to know. Late assignments will have 10% deducted for every day it is late.

30% - **Project**. This project will be assigned at the beginning of the course and will be worked on throughout the semester. Projects will be completed in groups with a peer evaluation at the end.

### 6. Honor Policy

The following examples are considered cheating in this class:

* Copying another student's assignments
* Copying another student's code
* Copying significant portions from sites like StackOverflow without citing your sources

The following examples are *not* considered cheating in this class:

* Discussing homework problems (this is different from copying someone's answers)
* Using StackOverflow for help (cite your sources for significant code)
* Referencing documentation
* Using a prebuilt library

This already a pass/fail course. You don't have to stress about your grade; we're trying to set up an environment for you to actually learn and get something out of this course.
